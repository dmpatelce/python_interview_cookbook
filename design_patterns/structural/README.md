# Structural Pattern ##############

These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 
Structural design patterns are Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and Proxy. 

Use Case Of Structural Design Pattern- 

1) When 2 interfaces are not compatible with each other and want to establish a relationship between them through an adapter itâ€™s called an adapter design pattern. The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface or class that the client expects, i.e adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatibility. so in these types of incompatible scenarios, we can go for the adapter pattern.

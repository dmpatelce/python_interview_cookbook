# Design Pattens ##############

Design Patterns is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They usually represent some of the best practices adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers.

We can not consider the Design Patterns as the finished design that can be directly converted into code. They are only templates that describe how to solve a particular problem with great efficiency. 
The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects.
The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms.
